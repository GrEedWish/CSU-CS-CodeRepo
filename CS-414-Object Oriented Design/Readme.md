## Object Oriented Design

Learn to analyze problems and develop conceptual models, generate designs from the models, and write program code that implements the designs. Students will also learn to evaluate and improve object-oriented models and code. They will use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to develop object models, and Java to implement the designs. The course will also introduce some facets from agile programming: very short software build cycles, and test-first programming.

- Java coding style and idioms.

- Object-oriented analysis and design.

- Problem analysis.

- Conceptual modeling.

- System behavior modeling.

- Software architecture.

- Design modeling.

- Design patterns.

- Design principles.

- Refactoring.
