Hydro-slotted perforation<====>35087381<====>Hydro-slotted perforation Hydro-slotting perforation technology is the process of opening the productive formation through the casing and cement sheath to produce the oil or gas product flow (intensification, stimulation).  The process has been used for industrial drilling since 1980, and involves the use of an underground hydraulic slotting engine (tool, equipment).  The technology helps to minimize compressive stress following drilling in the well-bore zone (which reduces the permeability in the zone).
