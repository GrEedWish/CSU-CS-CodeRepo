## Introduction to Machine Learning

This course covers fundamental concepts and methods of computational data analysis, including pattern classification, prediction, visualization, and recent topics in deep learning.

- read data files of various formats and visualize characteristics of the data,
- perform statistical analyses on multivariate data,
- develop and apply pattern classification algorithms to classify multivariate data,
- develop and apply regression algorithms for finding relationships between data variables,
- develop and apply reinforcement learning algorithms for learning to control complex systems,
- write scientific reports on computational machine learning methods, results and conclusions,
