## Introduction to Big Data

Modern scientific instruments and Internet-scale applications generate voluminous data pertaining to vital signs, weather phenomena, social networks that connect millions of users, and the origins of distant planets. Data produced in these settings hold th epromise to significantly advanced knowledge. This course covers fundamental issues in Big Data. The course examines issues related to data organization, storage, retrieval, analysis and knowledge discover at scale. This will include topics such as large-scale data analysis, data storage systems, self-descriptive data representations, semi-structured data models.This course will involve hands-on programming assignments and term project using real-world datasets.
